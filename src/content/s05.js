/* s05 — Typhoon Dolphin, eight hours out. CES film story only (not in the
   public 4-story loop; built via `CES=1 node build-app.js`).
   Ten cards per the design doc: hero + map, timeline, key facts (+deep),
   data chart, how it works, signal gauges, poll (+deep), why this matters,
   what's next. EN carries full Plain/Calm/ELI5 triples on the camera-critical
   cards (map, key facts, chart, gauges, poll, why); zh is a native Plain pass
   (voices fall back to Plain, same P1 pattern the four public stories shipped
   with before P3). No deaths, no destroyed homes — a big, loud, disruptive
   night, presented as a worked example. */
